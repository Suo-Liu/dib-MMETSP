# Base directory where scripts are run and files will be stored
base_dir = '~/'

# CSV file containing the MMETSP ids and SRA ids for the samples you want to run
sra_csv = 'SraRunInfo.csv'

# Assembly script to be run
assembly_version = 'assembly_trinity_2.2.0.py'

# Directory where scripts will be written within base_dir
scripts_dir = '~/scripts/'

# Directory where final output will be stored within base_dir
output_dir = '~/assembly_trinity_2.2.0/'

# Extension added to the end of the output files
output_extension = '.trinity_out_2.2.0'

# Extension for Trinity

# Directory where intermediate files will be stored
